# threexui_panel_user (Resource)

Manages the admin username and password for the 3x-ui panel.

This is a singleton resource -- only one instance should exist per provider. Deleting this resource only removes it from Terraform state; it does not revert the credentials.

~> **Warning:** After applying changes, keep the provider's steady-state `username` and `password` in sync with this resource. For first-run bootstrap of a fresh panel, the provider-level `bootstrap_username` and `bootstrap_password` arguments can authenticate with the initial credentials once, then this resource can rotate the panel to the steady-state credentials during the same apply.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "threexui_panel_user" "admin" {
  username = "myadmin"
  password = "s3cureP@ss"
}
```

### Write-Only Password (Terraform 1.11+ / OpenTofu 1.11+)

```hcl
resource "threexui_panel_user" "admin" {
  username            = "myadmin"
  password_wo         = "s3cureP@ss"
  password_wo_version = 1
}
```

## Argument Reference

- `username` (Required, String) - The desired admin username.
- `password` (Optional, String, Sensitive) - The desired admin password. Prefer `password_wo` on Terraform 1.11+ / OpenTofu 1.11+.
- `password_wo` (Optional, String, WriteOnly) - Write-only version of `password`. Not persisted in state. Terraform 1.11+ / OpenTofu 1.11+.
- `password_wo_version` (Optional, Number) - Increment to trigger re-send of `password_wo`. Must be set together with `password_wo`.

## Attribute Reference

- `id` (String) - Always `"user"`.

## Import

```shell
terraform import threexui_panel_user.admin user
```

~> **Note:** Because the panel has no API to read credentials, `username` and `password` are unknown after import. You must configure both attributes in your Terraform configuration and run `terraform apply` to synchronize the state. The next `terraform plan` after import will show changes for these attributes — this is expected.
